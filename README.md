# Docker-Forth - Docker images for popular Forth systems

When you try to write portable Forth programs it is hard to verify
that your program is in deed compatible to a wide variety of 
Standard Forth systems. It would be ideal if you could test your 
program against many systems. With Forth systems in docker containers
you now can.

This repository provides Dockerfiles for a growing number of 
popular Forth systems, so it is getting easy to run them for a
test drive.

If you are not familiar with Docker, read about it at
[www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).

If you want to write Standard Forth programs and contribute
them to the community have a look at
[forth-standard.org](http://forth-standard.org/ "Forth standard web page")
and 
[theforth.net](https://theforth.net/ "The Forthnet")

May the Forth be with you.
